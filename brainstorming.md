    Schedular App

<h2>
    Brainstorming

<h3>
    Main Idea
</h3>

I had an App Idea from the beginning and wanted to make an app that helps schedule trips and vacations with groups of friends.

<h3>
    Areas of Project:
</h3>

- Travel
- Productivity
- Social

<h3>
    App Evaluation
</h3>

**Mobile:** The experience is uniquely mobile due to how it sends notifications, uses contacts to connect people and also uses Maps as well.

**Story:** Just a joy in spending time with friends and whatever makes that easier can definitly help alot of people.

**Market**: The scope is very large cause we make plans and want to travel at all times and things that organize and connect people through this are very useful.

**Habit**: Being able to send timers to your friends is something I hope to implement

**Scope**: The app might be slightly challenging to make but I hope to do my best in getting my **MVP** made.
